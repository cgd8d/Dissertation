Without the help of my colleagues, advisor, friends, family, and my wife, this thesis and the work it embodies would never have happened.  I would like to give thanks to the EXO-200 collaboration, which has provided a supportive and stimulating environment for my work and learning over the past four years.

Particular thanks must go to: David Auty, Phil Barbeau, Giorgio Gratta, Steve Herrin, Sam Homiller, Mike Jewell, Tessa Johnson, Tony Johnson, Caio Licciardi, Mike Marino, Dave Moore, Russell Neilson, Igor Ostrovskiy, J.J. Russell, Kevin O'Sullivan, Tony Waite, Josiah Walton, Liangjian Wen, Liang Yang, and of course my advisor Carter Hall.  I can honestly say that each one of you directly made the following work possible with your contribution of insight, data, plots, and analysis.  Denoising has been a tremendously collaborative effort, and I am grateful that my last project with this group has provided the chance to work with all of you so closely.
