\chapter{Conclusions and Future Plans}

Future plans to mention:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run1 contains up to 90 livetime-days, which is not negligible; denoising should have a significant improvement in resolution to offer even though APD gains were lower then.  (Personal view -- our next paper should include a combined analysis of Run1+Run2abcde.)
\item Further improvements in denoising are known to be acheivable.
\item Electronics upgrade could be a future hardware improvement.
\item Restate some of the things listed in denoising, like anticorrelated cluster energies.
\item denoised u-wires for improved risetime.
\item lower threshold in scintillation.
\item understand how gain non-uniformity plays into resolution, and implications for nEXO.
\end{itemize}
