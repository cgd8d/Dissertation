The EXO-200 detector is designed to search for a theorized decay process of xenon-136 called neutrinoless double-beta ($\beta\beta 0\nu$) decay.  $\beta\beta 0\nu$ decay, if it occurs, would have important consequences for our understanding of the neutrino sector of the standard model.  It would demonstrate the type of the neutrino mass term; set the mass scale of the neutrino sector; and demonstrate the first direct observation of lepton number non-conservation.  The $\beta\beta 0\nu$ decay produces a monoenergetic peak, so one important approach to reducing backgrounds for this search is by improving the energy resolution of the detector.

The present work describes a new analysis technique which improves resolution in the scintillation channel by a combination of waveform denoising and weighting of waveform components based on their expected signal-to-noise ratio; the overall resolution of the detector is improved by better than $20\%$.  Application of this method results in a halflife limit on $\beta\beta 0\nu$ decay in xenon-136 of $T_{1/2} > 1.1 \cdot 10^{25}$ years at $90\%$ confidence.  Further improvements which could impact the energy resolution of EXO-200 are also described, and implications for the planned nEXO experiment are considered.
