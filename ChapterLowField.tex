\chapter{Low-Field Running}

I should write up at least a brief analysis of the low-field data, with denoising.  In particular, demonstrate resolution vs field.  This should be doable with the standard denoising lightmap, and I'll just expect the scintillation to peak somewhere other than 2615 keV.
